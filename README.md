# AI rust

This is a project in progress. It will contain data preprocessing code and ultimately several ML/DL scripts. 
It builds on the repo prediction-color-tags where Python was used to train a color classification model.
A first objective will be to use model inference in Rust and see how much faster it can classify a batch of images than Python.

Stay tuned and get in contact for question / suggestions!
